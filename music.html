    <h1>Any artists out there?</h1>

        <p>
            I'm really into music I must say. On one hand, I just LOVE calssical music, specifically Impressionist, Barroque and Jazz music, but I also like to listen to Romantic music if I'm reading, chilling or studying.

            I play the piano since I was 7. I'm just fond of it. I also used to play the cello at school, I wish I had one at home to continue with that! But man, they're just so expensive, right? But oh well, I found an acoustic guitar at home, so I'm just having fun learning and jamming with it. I'm an awful singer but at least I enjoy it (can't say the same about my neighbours, oops). Favourite artists? Bach, Debussy, Foret, Armstrong, Einaudi, and of course PIazzolla!

           Yet I also love to got out dancing with my friends; go Latin music! And in my spare time I listen to Rock nacional, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Marron 5, Tash Sultana, Miley Cyrus, and other awesome rock-ish bands.
